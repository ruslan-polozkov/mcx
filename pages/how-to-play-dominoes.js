                <h3>Strategy of Domino</h3>
                <p>Each experienced player has his own system of <strong>how to win at dominoes</strong>. He will truly believe that this
                system is one of the best. However, there are a few rules or tips, following which makes your game
                much easier, and the chances of success are enhanced. Tips will be given using a classic board game as
                  an example.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>1. Choosing a partner. According to the classical game rules, the game is played “wall-to-wall,” that
                is, in a two-on-two format. This means that two people should already have their <strong>secrets of
                dominoes</strong>: both you and your partner. Therefore, the choice of a player in a pair must be made
                with responsibility. He or she should be able to take the initiative in order to periodically take
                over the game when your play as a leader doesn’t work out. At the same time, in controversial
                moments, you must find some common ground in a split second, by understanding what is the
                best way to achieve victory as the team goal.</li>
                  <li>2. Scoring. This is an important element of every game. <strong>When playing dominoes, the tactics</strong>
                directly affects the number of points that the team will be added into its “previous score.” An
                important point to remember is the value of each dice. When you have several “dice” in your
                hands, among which there is “blank-blank,” this dice does not add points to you at all. But if it
                remains the only one in your hands, ten points are immediately added.</li>
                    <li>3. Mixing. Many textbooks on <strong>“Learn How to Play Dominoes”</strong> describe that the most important
                element in the game is the first move, as it sets the pace and mood of the whole game. But if
                you are playing live it is much more important to have a good mix. It is important here not to
                rush, but to calmly mix the dices with even movements. This minimizes the chances that one of
                the “dices” will turn over, which will lead to a tightening of the gap between games and
                dissatisfaction with your partner and the opposing team.</li>
                      <li>4. Starting deal. It is important to carefully examine the dices you’ve got. Five doubles or six
                identical numbers is a remix. But there is more to come. Evaluating the structure of the “dices”
                handed over to you, you build your strategy for the opening of the game. You begin to
                understand which numbers you should get rid of first, and which should be reserved for the
                        middle or even the denouement of the game.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Playing on the Internet is noticeably different from playing live, since when playing online you do not
                have the opportunity to follow the facial expressions, gestures and mood of your opponents and
                partner. However, this is a good way to learn how to play one of the most fascinating and interesting
                  board games of modern times. To learn the sacred <strong>techniques and secrets of dominoes</strong>, you need to
                  spend more than a dozen hours at the tables, because they are gained with experience!</p>
